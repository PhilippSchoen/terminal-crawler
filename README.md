# Terminal Crawler - Logical Agent Hacking Minigame
Little hacker-stylized practice project for logical agents and Canvas2D I coded where you place daemons and firewalls in your network,
to defend against a logical agent with a knowledge base, that is trying to breach your database.

All art and animations in the game are pure code.

You can play it here: [Terminal Crawler](https://philippschoen.github.io/terminal-crawler/)
